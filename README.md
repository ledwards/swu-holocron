# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) for testing.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also run tests with more detailed output:

```bash
npm test -- --verbose
```

### Test Structure

- `__tests__/BasicTest.js`: Basic tests to verify that Jest is working correctly
- `__tests__/components/`: Component-specific tests:
  - Basic component rendering
  - Themed components
  - Interactive components (Collapsible)

### Adding Tests

When adding new components or features, consider adding corresponding tests in the `__tests__` directory following the existing structure.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
